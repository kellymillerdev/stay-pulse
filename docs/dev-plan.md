## Interview Focus Points

### Architecture & Design

- [x] Monorepo structure using pnpm workspace
- [x] NestJS service architecture
- [x] Domain-driven design principles
- [x] TypeScript type safety throughout

### Core Feature: Churn Prediction

- [x] Multi-factor risk analysis implementation
- [x] Behavioral pattern analysis
- [x] Payment history evaluation
- [x] Engagement metrics processing
- [ ] Actionable recommendation generation

### Technical Implementation

- [x] Modern React patterns (hooks, TypeScript)
- [ ] Async processing with Bull queue
- [x] RESTful API design
- [ ] PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- [ ] Real-time monitoring capabilities

### Development Practices

- [x] Modern tooling (Turbopack, Next.js 14)
- [ ] Testing strategies
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Next Priority Tasks

1. Set up PostgreSQL connection with TypeORM
2. Implement Bull queue for async processing
3. Add basic error handling middleware
4. Begin dashboard UI implementation
